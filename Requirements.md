## Vision
### What is the vision of this product?
Intended for users who want to move outside of the country they currently live in, our app allows the user to search for a new country to move to by region or national language, as well as to search by country (if they have a target in mind and want to view details). 

### What pain point does this project solve?
When deciding on a huge life decision such as moving to another country, it is immensely helpful to have all of the data stored in one place. 

### Why should we care about your product?


## Scope (In/Out)

### IN
The web app will provide information to the users about all the different Cat Cafe’s in the area
The web app will provide both walking and driving directions to each of the destinations
Users will be able to “Star” their favorite shops.
Each shop will contain reviews of the customer’s experiences
### OUT
These should be features that you will make very clear from the beginning that you will not do during development. These should be limited and very few. Pick your battles wisely. This should only be 1 or 2 things. Example: My website will never turn into an IOS or Android app.

Non-Functional Requirements (301 & 401 only)
Non-functional requirements are requirements that are not directly related to the functionality of the application but still important to the app.

Examples include:

Security
Usability
Testability
etc….
Pick 2 non-functional requirements and describe their functionality in your application.

If you are stuck on what non-functional requirements are, do a quick online search and do some research. Write a minimum of 3-5 sentences to describe how the non-functional requirements fits into your app.

You MUST describe what the non-functional requirement is and how it will be implemented. Simply saying “Our project will be testable for testibility” is NOT acceptable. Tell us how, why, and what.
